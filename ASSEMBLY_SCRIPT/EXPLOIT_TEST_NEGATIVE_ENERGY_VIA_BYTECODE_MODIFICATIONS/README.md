# Bytecode modification before deploying and execution in <b>KLYNTAR VM</b>

<br/>

## <b>Intro</b>

Adversaries, in case that they know the name of imported energy-metering function may inject maulicious code to reduce energy usage. Usually metering function has such signature in <code>.wat</code> code

```wasm

 (import "metering" "usegas" (func $fimport$0 (param i32)))

```

To prevent maulicious activity we can randomize name of metering function e.g.

```wasm

(import "metering" "usegas" (func $0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef (param i32)))


```

Also, we can try to decompile the bytecode to <code>.wat</code> and in case of errors - it will be a pure signal of maulicious behaviour as well as in case of name conflicts

## <b>Conslusion</b>

We'll give more information soon. We continue to work
